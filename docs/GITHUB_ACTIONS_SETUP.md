# GitHub Actions Setup Summary

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## 🎯 Created Workflows

### 1. Main CI Pipeline (`ci.yml`)
**Purpose:** Comprehensive testing and building

**Flow:**
```
Push/PR → Type Check → Unit Tests → E2E Tests → Build → Upload Artifacts
```

**Features:**
- ✅ TypeScript compilation check
- ✅ 26 unit tests with Vitest
- ✅ 18 E2E tests with Playwright (Chromium + Firefox)
- ✅ Code coverage with Codecov
- ✅ Parallel execution
- ✅ Artifact uploads (reports + builds)

**Artifacts (retention):**
- playwright-report (30 days)
- coverage-report (30 days)
- extension-builds (90 days)

---

### 2. Test Pipeline (`test.yml`)
**Purpose:** Separated test jobs for flexibility

**Jobs:**
1. **unit-tests** - Vitest + Coverage
2. **e2e-tests** - Playwright + Browser install
3. **build** - Extension packaging

**Use case:** When you want to see test results separately

## 📊 Test Matrix

| Test Type | Framework | Tests | Browsers | Coverage |
|-----------|-----------|-------|----------|----------|
| Unit      | Vitest    | 26    | -        | ✅       |
| E2E       | Playwright| 18    | Chrome, Firefox | ✅ |

**Total:** 44 tests running on every push/PR

---

## 🚀 Triggers

Both workflows run on:
- ✅ Push to `main` or `master`
- ✅ Pull requests to `main` or `master`
- ✅ Push to `develop` (CI only)

## 📈 Status Badges

Added to README.md:

```

## 🔧 Local vs CI

### What CI runs:
```bash
bun run typecheck          # TypeScript check
bunx vitest run            # Unit tests
bunx vitest run --coverage # Coverage
bun run build              # Build extension
bun run test:e2e           # E2E tests
```

### Run locally:
```bash
# Quick test
bunx vitest run && bun run test:e2e

# Full CI simulation
bun run typecheck && \
bunx vitest run --coverage && \
bun run build && \
bun run test:e2e
```

---

## 📦 Artifacts Available

After each workflow run:

### 1. Playwright Report
- Path: `playwright-report/`
- Contains: Screenshots, traces, test results
- View: Download & open `index.html`

### 2. Coverage Report
- Path: `coverage/`
- Contains: HTML coverage report
- View: Download & open `index.html`

### 3. Extension Builds
- Files: `immo24-chromium.zip`, `immo24-firefox.zip`
- Ready to install
- Retention: 90 days

---

## ✅ Verification

To verify the workflows work:

1. **Push to master:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add CI/CD workflows"
   git push origin master
   ```

2. **Check Actions tab:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/kidzki/immo24-address-decoder/actions
   - See both workflows running

3. **Expected result:**
   - ✅ CI workflow: All tests pass
   - ✅ Test workflow: All jobs pass
   - ✅ Artifacts uploaded

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Workflow fails on first run?
- Install Playwright browsers: `bunx playwright install --with-deps`
- Check node_modules: `bun install`

### Coverage upload fails?
- Add `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret to repo (optional)
- Or ignore - coverage still generated as artifact

### E2E tests fail?
- Check Playwright report artifact
- Screenshots show what went wrong
- Run locally: `bun run test:e2e:ui`

## 📚 Documentation Created

1. ✅ `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Main CI pipeline
2. ✅ `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Updated test workflow
3. ✅ `.github/workflows/README.md` - Workflow overview
4. ✅ `docs/CI_CD.md` - Comprehensive CI/CD documentation
5. ✅ `README.md` - Added CI/Test badges

---

## 🎉 Benefits

- ✅ Automated testing on every push
- ✅ Prevent broken builds
- ✅ Code coverage tracking
- ✅ Browser compatibility testing
- ✅ Ready-to-install builds
- ✅ PR status checks
- ✅ Build artifacts for download

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Push changes to trigger workflows
2. Check Actions tab for results
3. Configure Codecov token (optional)
4. Add branch protection rules (optional)

**Status:** 🟢 Ready to use!
